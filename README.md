## A simple Reimbursement Calculator using React.js..
This calculator helps buyers claim reimbursements when they order live sea-food and it shows up half-dead or something.

There are a common set of rules that merchants must agree to when using live-seafood marketplace to sell.  
These rules are designed to protect the buyers and are unique to live seafood trade as the goods are perishable. Part of the rules involve merchants reimbursing their buyers for unsatisfactory or incomplete transactions.

#### In this app, there are 3 scenarios in which the merchant must reimburse money to the buyer:
(1) for mortality - when a percentage of the seafood supplied is dead on arrival;  
(2) for shrinkage - when the seafood loses water weight in transit; and  
(3) for cancellations - when the merchant is unable to fulfil an agreed order
